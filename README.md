In this project, I was tasked to do a map visualization of the bfro_location dataset based on the classification of the longitude and latitude in the US and Canada. First, I cleaned the dataset based on the longitude and latitude for the US and Canada, so that my analyzes can only focus in the US and Canada rather then the entire world since the classification dataset contains information on various locations, including classifications, latitudes, longitudes, and other relevant details. The classifications are divided into three categories: Class A, Class B, and Class C. With that cleaning I was able to make a map visualizes the geographic distribution of Bigfoot sightings across the United States and Canada. Also, to conclude my analyzes I had done the statistical summary to determines summary, average, means, max, min, of each classification based on the longitude and latidute I have visualize.
